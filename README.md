# SlideHarvest

SlideHarvest is a browser extension that automatically detects publicly embedded slide presentations, such as Google Slides in iframes, and captures them in high resolution. It then compiles them into a single, clean PDF for easy storage and sharing — without manual screenshots or image stitching.

## Features
- Detects embedded public presentations in iframes.
- Captures slides in high resolution without browser UI elements.
- Exports directly to PDF.
- Works in the background while you continue browsing.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

## How It Works
1. Open any webpage containing a public embedded slide presentation.
2. Activate SlideHarvest from the browser toolbar.
3. Select the presentation you want to capture.
4. Let the extension run in the background as it processes all slides.
5. Receive a clean, high-resolution PDF at the end.

## Installation
### Development Mode
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension` folder.

*(Future versions will be available in the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons.)*

## Roadmap
